    <p>In the fast-paced world of cybersecurity, beginners often rush into technical tools without building a solid foundation in basic security principles. One of the most common mistakes is neglecting to update and patch systems regularly. Cyber attackers thrive on known vulnerabilities that remain unpatched for months or even years.</p>
    <p>Another frequent error is poor password hygiene. Reusing weak passwords across multiple accounts is like leaving your house keys under the doormat—it’s only a matter of time before someone takes advantage. Password managers and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be a default practice for anyone serious about security.</p>
    <p>Beginners also underestimate the importance of network segmentation and least privilege. Giving every user unrestricted access to critical systems dramatically increases the damage potential of a single breach. Always ensure that access rights are granted only to those who absolutely need them.</p>
    <p>Finally, many new professionals fail to test their own security. Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and regular audits are not just for large enterprises—they are essential habits for all security practitioners, regardless of experience.</p>
