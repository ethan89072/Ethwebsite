      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">EzmCyber</span> was founded by <strong>Niffy</strong>, a hands-on cybersecurity analyst with years of experience in ethical hacking, incident response, and network defense. Our mission is simple: empower individuals and organizations to defend against evolving digital threats with confidence and precision.
      </p>
      <p>
        At EzmCyber, we focus on delivering actionable guidance, practical tools, and real-world tutorials. We believe cybersecurity should be approachable, measurable, and effective — whether you are securing a small startup, fortifying corporate networks, or safeguarding government infrastructure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work is grounded in real experience. Every tool, post, and guide is tested and proven, ensuring you get reliable solutions instead of theory. Our community thrives on collaboration, learning, and building stronger digital defenses together.
